# Project-Portfolio by Chika Ozodiegwu 
This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and projects that i created for data analysis and visualization.

# Excel

[Github](https://github.com/chikaozodiegwu/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Notebooks/Excel_Chika%20Ozodiegwu.xlsx)

This Microsoft Excel project was completed as part of my bootcamp homework. To uncover some market trends, I modified and analyzed the data of 4,000 kickstarter projects. I used several functions including conditional formatting, COUNTIFS, IFERROR, LEFT/RIGHT/MID and LEN. I also created pivot tables and pivot charts to visualized my analysis. 

# Python

[Github](https://github.com/chikaozodiegwu/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Notebooks/Python_main.py) 

For this Python project, i created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. I used VS code to conduct the analysis. I imported the csv file that included the financial budget data, created lists to store the data, read rows from the CSV and iterated through the list and performed several analysis. 

# Pandas 

[Github](https://github.com/chikaozodiegwu/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Notebooks/Pandas_HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb)
For this project, i analyzed a fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli. I used Jupyter Notebook to conduct this analysis. I imported all the dependencies needed from the Pandas Library, imported the CSV file that i used, cleaned the data and conducted various analysis. 

# Matplotlib 

[Github](https://github.com/chikaozodiegwu/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Notebooks/Matplotlib_pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb)

For this project, i generated tables and figures. After importing the data to Jupyter Notebook, i cleaned the data, generated summary statistics, generated plots and performed data analysis to calculate various results. 

# COVID-19 Project (Group Project)

[Github](https://github.com/chikaozodiegwu/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Notebooks/COVID-19%20Project%20Notebook.ipynb)

This group project as part of my bootcamp projects reviewed the COVID-19 hospitalization rate in Florida. I was responsible for cleaning the data and performing various analysis including hospitalization by gender, calculated total number of cases by county, top ten hospitalization by county, percentage of hospitlaiztion by gender and age group. I also visualized my result with bar and pie plots. 

# SQL

[Github](https://github.com/chikaozodiegwu/Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Notebooks/SQL) 

For this project, i designed tables to hold data in the CSVs, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and answered questions about the data. I inspected the CSV, sketched out an ERD of thge tables and performed data engineering and data analysis. 

# ETL 

[Github](https://github.com/chikaozodiegwu/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Notebooks/ETL%20Project.ipynb)

For this project, i utilized data from Kaggle on inpatient and outpatient fraud in the US. The data itself was created for machine learning. I focused on using the "Train" dataset. I imported all dependencies from the libraries, imported the CSV files, merged CSVs and connected the notebook to a local database using an engine, queried the databased from the notebook and performed various analysis. 

# Tableau 

[Github](https://github.com/chikaozodiegwu/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Notebooks/Tableau-psychiatric_health.twbx)

For this project, i worked with 2014 data on in-patient psychiatric patient care in hospitals across the United States. I cleaned the CSV data file using Jupyter Notebook and imported the clean CSV into Tableau. Afterwards, i interpreted the data by creating various dashboards and other visualiztions to explore/interpret the data
